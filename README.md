# lichie.gransynth
A Quasi-Synchronous Granular synth built in MaxMSP

Initally a University project submitted for my degree in Music Technology, it will now be improved upon and maintained through this repository.

Please see the Whitepaper of the project, Generative Chaos - Modulating a Granular Synthesizer in camhoot/lichie.gransynth/misc
This should give more context into the original project idea.
