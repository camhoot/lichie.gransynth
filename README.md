### A Quasi-Synchronous Granular synth built in MaxMSP

Initally a University project submitted for my degree in Music Technology, it will now be improved upon and maintained through this repository.

Please see the Whitepaper of the project, [Generative Chaos - Modulating a Granular Synthesizer](lichie.gransynth/misc)

This should give more context into the original project idea.

## Details 

There are several parameters the user has control over, such as Grain Spray (the spread of the grain from the initial start position), Grain Size (the length of each grain), Grain Speed (the pitch of each grain), Length Between Grains, Grain Window (add zero crossing, reduces harsh pops at the start of each grain), Grain Amplitude and Grain Pan. The number of grains available to synth can also be easily changed.
